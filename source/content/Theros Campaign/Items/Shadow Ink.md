**Current Owner:** [[Percy]]

**Type**: Ink

**Effect:** Once penned, this special ink can only be seen and read in total darkness. When in darkness, any written or tattooed words, illustrations, or other marks made with this ink glow with a soft colored light. One bottle of shadow ink has enough ink to fill 10 pages with writing, illustrations, or other such markings.
