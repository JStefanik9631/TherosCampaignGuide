**Current Owner:** Party

**Type**: Tent

**Effect:** This folded triangle of multicolored canvas is 1 foot long and 6 inches wide. It weighs 1 pound. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it:

- The first command word causes the canvas to unfurl into a camping tent that's large enough for two Medium creatures or three Small ones. The tent is 7 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 4 feet tall. The tent comes equipped with two bedrolls, blankets, and a hooded lamp.
    
- The second command word causes the canvas to unfurl into a 20-foot-radius yurt that's 10 feet tall. Inside the yurt are ten bedrolls and blankets surrounding a stone-ringed fire pit equipped with cook's utensils. A fire within the pit creates no smoke and doesn't use oxygen.
    
- The third command word causes the tent or yurt to fold back into the canvas triangle, provided that there aren't any creatures inside. Items left within the area are ejected from the canvas when it folds itself up.
    

Removing an item that appears with the tent or yurt causes it to disappear until the next time the command word is used to reform the area. The atmosphere inside the area is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. You can choose what color the tent or yurt are as part of speaking the command word, which are opaque from the outside.
