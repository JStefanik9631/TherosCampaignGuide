**Current Owner:** Party

**Type**: Mirror

**Effect:** While standing in front of the mirror, you can speak the command word using an action to gain the effects of the [disguise self](https://5e.tools/spells.html#disguise%20self_xphb) spell (save DC 13). This version of the spell lasts for 8 hours, until you use an action to speak the command word again, or until another creature uses an action to make a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that you are disguised.
