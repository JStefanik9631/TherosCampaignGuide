**Current Owner:** [[Corvel]]

**Type**: Wand (requires attunement)

**Effect:** This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [Fireball](https://5e.tools/spells.html#fireball_xphb) (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 3 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

Regaining Charges. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
