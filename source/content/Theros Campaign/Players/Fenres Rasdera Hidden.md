3. Village was attacked by the [[Gold Horns]]. He was able to ambush the leader of the [[Gold Horns]], [[Garrios the Invincible]], stabbing him several times in the back of the head with a butter knife. A voice from [[Iroas]] himself spoke to him, telling him to submit. He was promptly knocked out by [[Garrios the Invincible|Garrios]], who seemed indifferent to his injuries.  
4. He was captured and taken to the [[Gold Horns]] encampment, not knowing if anyone else survived.
5. For several years he was beaten, trained, and tortured to become a killing machine worthy of the [[Gold Horns]].
6. On a particular rough day, he attacked and killed one of the trainers at the encampment after [[Iroas]] told him to stand up and fight. His treatment gradually became better afterwards, and he became a true member of the [[Gold Horns]] soon after. The initiation involved taking a trip to the [[Ashlands]] with several other members of the [[Gold Horns]]. 
7. He arrived several weeks later at the castle of the [[King of the Ashlands]]. While there, the [[Gold Horns]] sold gemstones as well as captured slaves to the [[King of the Ashlands|King]]. The [[King of the Ashlands|King]] later touched his horns, which almost instantly turned gold, his initiation was complete. He later came to the realization of what the golden statues in the [[King of the Ashlands|King]]'s throne room most likely were. 
8. The [[Gold Horns]] also met up with the [[Felhide Clan]] before leaving the [[Ashlands]]. The [[Felhide Clan]] were sold the slaves that the [[King of the Ashlands|King]] would not buy. From the stories he had heard, the [[Felhide Clan]] would be having a feast tonight...
9. While working as a guard for the encampment, one night he received his third message from [[Iroas]], telling him to leave the [[Gold Horns]] and to enact revenge another day. He stowed away in the night, with no one the wiser. 
10. After days of traveling with no help in sight, he was rescued by [[Perthos]]. 
11. He spent the next few years helping others and learning from [[Perthos]] about the strength of ancestral spirits and how to utilize them. 
12. While traveling, he came across the small village of [[Antolis]]. While there, he teamed up with [[Phylin]] to defeat a [[Gorgon|gorgon]] that was experimenting on the local populace. After dealing with the [[Gorgon|gorgon]], both of them remained in [[Antolis]] to ensure the townsfolk were healed properly. 

**Campaign History:**

2. Tried and failed to protect [[Phylin]] from the final attack of [[Phythaezea]]. [[Percy]] gave [[Phylin]]'s soul coin to him as a remembrance which could also be used to ask [[Phylin]] one last question. He fashioned it into a necklace that he wears. 
3. Carried [[Phylin]]'s body to the [[Pools of Lyth]] and prayed to [[Pharika]] with [[Halcyon]] to try and revive her. [[Phylin]]'s familiar appeared to them and informed them that [[Phylin]] did not wish to return due to her affliction turning her into a [[Daughter of Pharika]]. They respected her wishes and decided to not revive her. He offered his finals words to the familiar to bring to [[Phylin]], “Thank you for being one of so very few to see me for the monster I am not. I only wish you got to see the parts of me that were so much more.”
