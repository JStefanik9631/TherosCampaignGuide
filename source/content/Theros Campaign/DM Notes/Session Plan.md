________________________________________________

Beneath the sky where tempests roar,  
Where stars in endless patterns soar,  
Phenax spoke with a cunning grin,  
"A game of fate—shall we begin?

Grant mortal minds a touch of flame,  
And see if ruin takes their name.  
Inspire their hearts, unseen, unknown,  
And watch the seeds of chaos sown."

The silent god, their face concealed,  
Agreed to see what fate revealed.  
With unseen hand, they cast the spark,  
And lit the path both bright and dark.

Eight souls arose, their hearts alight,  
Each cursed to weave the threads of blight.

The first awoke with painted guise,  
Their words a web of truth and lies.  
Their stage became a treacherous snare,  
And none could see the danger there.

The second brewed in shadowed glow,  
A poison none would dare to know.  
With whispered words and secrets vile,  
They labored long to beguile.

Another shaped with hands of gold,  
Devices vast, both new and old.  
Their wonders spun from boundless dreams,  
Became machines of fatal schemes.

A sailor braved the tempest’s tide,  
Where unseen horrors seethe and bide.  
They mapped a course through waters cursed,  
And doomed the world with each traverse.

Deep in the earth, with lantern’s gleam,  
Another sought a fractured dream.  
Through depths unknown, their hands laid bare  
The ancient power slumbering there.

Their shadow looms where kinfolk tread,  
A whispered name the wise still dread.  
Their will commands, their gaze consumes,  
A living curse the bloodline blooms.

A thief of breath, unseen, untold,  
Their touch as sharp as winter’s cold.  
Through shadowed streets, they wove their way,  
And stole the dawn from breaking day.

But one was shrouded, name and face,  
A fleeting ghost, a hollow space.  
Even gods could not define  
The source of this enigma’s line.

And so the world, in silence, turned,  
As fires rose and futures burned.  
What gods began, the mortals sealed,  
A truth untamed, a fate revealed.

## Ash Storm

From a Distance Description:
_As you crest a ridge, you see it in the distance: a wall of darkness stretching from horizon to horizon. Not a storm of rain or thunder, but of ash — thick, swirling, and alive. Jagged veins of red pulse within the cloud like molten blood in an open wound. Wind rushes ahead of it in gusts that smell of cinders and rot, carrying the faint screams of the dead — or maybe it’s just the wind playing tricks on your ears._

_Then you feel it. The air gets hotter. Drier. Every breath tastes like soot. The sky turns a shade darker, and the ground trembles with the weight of what’s coming. You realize: this is no simple storm. This is the land itself trying to erase you._ 

What would you like to do?

Start of Encounter:
*A wall of swirling gray and ember-tipped black clouds rushes across the horizon. In seconds, it consumes the landscape. Your lungs burn, your skin prickles, and the world turns dark and hot.*

- **CON Save (DC 13, every 10 minutes)**:  
    Inhalation of hot ash. On fail: 1 level of **exhaustion** (non-magical protection helps; masks, wet cloths, etc.).
    
- **DEX Save (DC 14)**:  
    Debris flying in high winds. Fail = 1d6 bludgeoning + knocked prone.
    
- **WIS (Survival) or INT (Nature) Check (DC 15)**:  
    Players can orient themselves or seek safe ground.
    
- **Perception (Disadvantage)**:  
    Visual checks have disadvantage due to ash obscuring vision (hearing still works).

5 Ash Wraiths appear as well.

*The world is eerily still. The ashstorm has passed, but it left the land scoured and silent — a gray, smothered ruin. Fine black dust carpets everything, muting colors and sound alike. Charred rocks jut like broken bones from the earth, and the air tastes of burnt metal and old sorrow. The sky above is a dull, sickly orange, and the sun — if it still exists — is a dim smudge behind layers of haze. No wind, no birds, no life. Just the quiet crunch of ash beneath your boots, and the slow realization that you survived something the land itself seemed to want you to forget. And as you look around, you see a trail of several footprints heading off into the distance, somehow undisturbed by the storm.*

# Long Term Plans

Maybe have Alex's sister be dead or swapped bodies with Patriarch. Not ideal but could not find Corvel or Reginald.

Find a haunted village beset by a group of necromancers and hordes of undead

After returning have people hear of their exploits and want to join. Archibald may want to join as well, tells others and there are auditions.

Researchers break into new plane trying to get to the God plane. End up in Barovia? Or another plane

champions of old gods greek ones

reginald returns possesed unknowing to the party

While traveling party hears a flute concert going on near a small hamlet. As they enter everyone is cheering but the concert ends once they arrive. Villagers insist they stay the night and listen to the traveling bard in the morning. Party attends and a fog rolls in. After a blink, a shadow dark figure with horns arrives on the stage, unmoving. If the party approaches, it lifts a finger and an audience member's arm snaps like a twig, the villager is unphased. The figure is of the same class the Butler. A few checks will immediately determine that as well as Corvel knowing.

Musician Fight

Phase 1

- **Villager Screen**:  
    The villagers act as living cover. Any ranged AoE risks harming innocents.
    
- **Harmony of Obedience (Lair Action)**  
    Every round, 1–2 villagers step forward and grapple or restrain a random party member, trying to “bring them back to the music.”
    
- **Shadow Shots**  
    The Minstrel only attacks through **shadow tentacles** or blasts from rooftops. He is **untouchable** until broken out of this phase. **2d8 + 4 (avg 13)**

Phase 2
- **Claw / Reach Strike (melee):** `3d8 + 4 (avg 17.5)`, **slashing/necrotic**
- **Shadow Blink**: Teleports between patches of darkness.
    
- **Piercing Note (Cone Attack)**: Psychic damage + forced movement. **6d6 psychic (avg 21)**
    
- **Discordant Harmony (Legendary Action)**: Forces two players to make a Wis save or attack each other once.

The lanterns around the square begin to **dim** every round.

- At 75% light → Minstrel gains ½ cover.
    
- At 50% light → Minstrel becomes resistant to weapon damage.
    
- At total darkness → Phase 3 triggers automatically.
    

Phase 3
- **Shadow Doppelgängers**  
    The Minstrel creates **copies of the party members**, each weaker but mimicking their abilities.
    
- **Grasping Spotlight**  
    A moving cone of dim light sweeps the arena:
    
    - Standing in it gives advantage on attacks.
        
    - The Minstrel avoids it at all costs.
        
- **Tethered Souls**  
    Each round, one player must make a Wis save or have a **shadow chain** connect them to the Minstrel. **1d6 (avg 3.5)**
    
    - While tethered → They take damage when the Minstrel does.
        
    - Breaking the chain requires STR or radiant damage.

Phase 4

- **Final Cacophony (Recharge 5–6)**  
    30 ft radius sonic burst; pushes and deafens. **8d8 (avg 36)**
    
- **Consume Shadow**  
    Targets a prone or unconscious creature to heal. **`6d8 (avg 27)`** necrotic (use sparingly).
    
- **Screeching Counterpoint (Reaction)**  
    When hit by magic → He emits a counter-tone that forces a concentration check on the caster. **`3d8 (avg 13.5)` psychic**
    
**Multi-limb Slash (melee attack):** **`4d8 + 6 (avg 24)`**
    

Any light source the party enhances (Light spell, torches, radiant abilities) now **burns him**, making him vulnerable to radiant damage.
