Beneath the sky where tempests roar,  
Where stars in endless patterns soar,  
Phenax spoke with a cunning grin,  
"A game of fate—shall we begin? 

Grant mortal minds a touch of flame,  
And see if ruin takes their name.  
Inspire their hearts, unseen, unknown,  
And watch the seeds of chaos sown." 

The silent god, their face concealed,  
Agreed to see what fate revealed.  
With unseen hand, they cast the spark,  
And lit the path both bright and dark. 

Eight souls arose, their hearts alight,  
Each cursed to weave the threads of blight. 

The first awoke with painted guise,  
Their words a web of truth and lies.  
Their stage became a treacherous snare,  
And none could see the danger there. 

The second brewed in shadowed glow,  
A poison none would dare to know.  
With whispered words and secrets vile,  
They labored long to beguile. 

Another shaped with hands of gold,  
Devices vast, both new and old.  
Their wonders spun from boundless dreams,  
Became machines of fatal schemes. 

A sailor braved the tempest’s tide,  
Where unseen horrors seethe and bide.  
They mapped a course through waters cursed,  
And doomed the world with each traverse. 

Deep in the earth, with lantern’s gleam,  
Another sought a fractured dream.  
Through depths unknown, their hands laid bare  
The ancient power slumbering there. 

Their shadow looms where kinfolk tread,  
A whispered name the wise still dread.  
Their will commands, their gaze consumes,  
A living curse the bloodline blooms. 

A thief of breath, unseen, untold,  
Their touch as sharp as winter’s cold.  
Through shadowed streets, they wove their way,  
And stole the dawn from breaking day. 

But one was shrouded, name and face,  
A fleeting ghost, a hollow space.  
Even gods could not define  
The source of this enigma’s line. 

And so the world, in silence, turned,  
As fires rose and futures burned.  
What gods began, the mortals sealed,  
A truth untamed, a fate revealed.
